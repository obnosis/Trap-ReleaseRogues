# Trap-Release Rogues
 
Our purpose is to raise awareness about current non-secret techniques deployed by federal investigative staff and security contractors.  Anyone operating at a high technical level could be targeted for stalking. Once a rogue team or criminal has occupancy, watching everything their quarry does, its impossible to make a move without their counter move.   It is imperative that everyone becomes familiar with tools currently available and in use for rogue intimidation and harassment.

Any technical relief requires substantial "slight of hand" so, we also can provide support or refer community professionals and individuals to InfoSec teams willing to act in concert to lay "traps" to expose rogue illegal aggressive survelliance.
