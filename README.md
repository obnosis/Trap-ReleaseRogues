# Trap-ReleaseRogues
 
Our purpose is to raise awareness about current non-secret techniques deployed by federal investigative staff and security contractors.  Anyone operating at a high technical level could be targeted for stalking. Once a rogue team or criminal has occupancy, watching everyone their quarry does, its impossible to make a move without their counter move.   It is imperative that everyone becomes familiar with tools currently available and in use for rogue intimidation and harassment.
